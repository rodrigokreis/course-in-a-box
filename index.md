### What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)

### Audience
This course is designed for working professionals and targets a heterogeneous audience, varying from AI & ML technical staff to more general and administrative positions, such as Project Managers and Supervisors. Specifically there are three target audiences:

* Practitioners: those that build or manage the development of AI in their organizations
* Facilitators: those responsible for guiding the learning cycle
* Instructors: those who are responsible for adding relevant content/case studies to material, preferably shared on our platform

No advanced skills in math, programming, or AI are required for participation. Knowledge of RAI concepts or techniques is also not required or expected. Whether you are an RAI enthusiast or a skeptic, and whether or not your role is technical, this course is for you!

### About this Course
Welcome to the Center for Responsible AI's course "[TODO: Don't be evil! A practical approach to Responsible Artificial Intelligence (RAI)]". This course provides resources for digital practitioners and those interested in the intricacies of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to avoid the misuse of algorithmic systems in ways that improve society rather than multiply negative practices.

This course was designed to help RAI practitioners with two main tasks:
1. Provide practitioners the tools and resources to learn about RAI concepts with a stakeholder-first approach.
2. Act as a toolkit for facilitators and instructors, providing resources to educate other practitioners.

This course gives a general overview of RAI concepts and techniques and uses case studies to make material accessible and relevant to your work. The course includes general background and examples of case studies. The course is structured as a learning circle and supports those who have taken the course to serve as facilitators for future offerings. We provide a facilitator guide to support individuals in this role.

The course makes heavy use of case studies because of three main reasons:
1. The analysis of a real-world case study makes the learning process more interactive and exciting for those who are assessing a particular problem and building a common understanding.
2. It is easier for participants to extrapolate their understanding of RAI concepts given a paradigmatic case study. 
3. Given that the RAI concepts are mostly abstract by nature, grounding them in tangible examples is an adequate manner to instruct the participants. 

We “seed” the course with several case studies and provide resources (guidelines, formatting instructions, jamboards, and other resources) for others to develop and incorporate their case studies into the materials. We invite the community to contribute case studies and make them public on our platform for others to use.
